question: "Do you offer any discounts?"
---

Yes, we offer several discount options:

- **Early Bird**: We have tiered pricing that increases over time. I once tried to do an exponential pricing system based on what number ticket you purchased and it was a huge mess. So this one just has date cutoffs. 

- **Volunteer**: If you can help out over the weekend, we'll give you a free ticket.

- **Hidden discounts**: Games appear in surprising places. Different discount codes will get you different amounts off. Each code can only be used once.

- **Community Partner Discount**: Look, if you want to be a major sponsor, we'll give you a free ticket. It's a weird notion of "free", but we live in weird times.

We're committed to making our conference accessible to a wide range of attendees. If you have any questions about our discount options, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
